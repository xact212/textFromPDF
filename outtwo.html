Critical Pedagogy: An Introduction
<p>

A society which makes provision for participation in its good of all members on equal terms and which secures flexible readjustment of its institutions through interaction of the different forms of associated life is in so far democratic.
Such a society must have a type of education which gives individuals a personal interest in social relationships and control, and the habits of mind which secure social changes.John Dewey

The education of any people should begin with the people themselves.Carter G.

We believe that Education leads to action.Myles Horton

Students live in a historical situation, in a social, political and economic moment.
Those things have to be part of what we teach.Herbert Kohl
Founder of the Open School Movement, 1964

The dual society, at least in public education, seems in general to be unquestioned.Jonathan Kozol

If situations cannot be created that enable the young to deal with feelings of being manipulated by outside forces, there will be far too little sense of agency among them.
Without a sense of agency, young people are unlikely to pose significant questions, the existentially rooted ques-tions in which learning begins.Maxine Green

Many students, especially those who are poor, intuitively know what the schools do for them.
They school them to confuse process and substance.
Once these become blurred, a new logic is assumed: the more treatment there is, the better are the results; or escalation leads to success.
The pupil is thereby schooled to confuse teaching with learning, grade advancement with education, a diploma with competence and fluency with the ability to say something new.Ivan Illich

Critical Pedagogy2

Knowledge emerges only through invention and re-invention, through the restless, impatient continuing, hopeful inquiry [we] pursue in the world, with the world, and with each other.Paulo Freire
<em>Pedagogy of the Oppressed</em>, 1971

Our analysis of the repressiveness, inequality, and contradictory objectives of contemporary education in America is not only a critique of schools and educators, but also of the social order of which they are a part.Samuel Bowles & Herbert Gintis
<em>Schooling in Capitalist America,</em> 1976
<p>

The words and concerns expressed here illustrate that the struggle for democratic public schooling in America has been a multidimensional enterprise, which for over a century has occupied the dreams, hearts, and minds of progressive educators.
These educators were not only firmly committed to the ideal and practice of social justice within schools, but to the transformation of social structures and class conditions within society that thwart the democratic participation of all people.Hence, critical pedagogy loosely evolved out of a yearning to give some shape and coherence to the theoretical landscape of radical principles, beliefs, and practices that contributed to transformative ideals of democratic schooling in the U.S.
during the twen-tieth century.
The development of this school of thought reflected a significant attempt to bring an array of similar and divergent views and perspectives to the table in order to invigorate the capacity of radical educators to engage critically with the impact of capitalism and gendered, racialized, and homophobic relations on students from histori-cally disenfranchised populations.
Moreover, underlying this radical tradition are revo-lutionary imperatives that are linked to the abolition of class and the social and material reconfiguration of society.The first textbook use of the term <em>critical pedagogy</em> is found in Henry Girouxs <em>Theory and Resistance in Education,</em> published in 1983.
During the 1980s and 1990s, Girouxs work, along with that of Paulo Freire, Stanley Aronowitz, Michael Apple, Maxine Greene, Peter Mc
Laren, bell hooks, Donaldo Macedo, Antonia Darder, Michelle Fine, Jean Anyon and many others was, inarguably, one of the most central and potent forces in the revital-ization of emancipatory educational debates in this country.
However, Giroux would be the first to adamantly insist that critical pedagogy emerged from a long historical legacy of radical social thought and progressive educational movements, which aspired to link practices of schooling to democratic principles of society and transformative social action in the interest of oppressed communities.There is no doubt that in the last four decades monumental historical events have trans-pired that have both exposed and challenged the debilitating nature of neoliberal policies within education and across the nation.
Some of the most obvious include: financial sector abuses that led to the mortgage collapse of 2007; the recalcitrant economic gap between the rich and the poor; the expansion of the prison industrial complex; contemporary oppres-sion of indigenous and immigrant communities; the college admission scandal of 2019 in the midst of an unprecedented student debt crisis; serious environmental conditions asso-ciated with climate change; the deaths of unarmed civilian Black men including George Floyd in May 2020 at the hands of police officerswhich gave rise to the international mobilization of the Black Lives Matter movement; the Covid-19 pandemic that for almost two years disrupted business-as-usual exposing the ugly underbelly of capitalist inequali-ties; the massive political disorganization of Trumpian schemes (i.e., the January 6 attack </HTML>
